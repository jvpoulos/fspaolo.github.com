<p>I work primarily with observations. I am interested in the large-scale monitoring of the Earth&#8217;s surface. My past and current work include mapping and change detection of Earth&#8217;s topography, bathymetry and gravity field, as observed by radar, lidar, imagery, sonar and gravimeters, among others. The following technologies constitute the core of our tools. We use high-performance computing (<span class="caps">HPC</span>) to process large-scale satellite altimeter data. Our processing is done mainly on the <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/">San Diego Supercomputer Center (<span class="caps">SDSC</span>)</a>&#8216;s clusters, as well as on a local computing grid (several multi-core Mac Pros coupled with the Xgrid software, by myself). The parallel processing is done using Message Passing Interface (<span class="caps">MPI</span>) and high-performance open-source (Python!) libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTables). We store and manage information using the <span class="caps">HDF5</span> and NetCDF4 data models. The visualization is performed primarily with ParaView, Mayavi, Matplotlib and <span class="caps">GMT</span> (all open-source!). Examples of advanced methods for signal detection and characterization we have used include: gaussian process regression (kriging interpolation), multi-channel singular spectrum analysis (<span class="caps">MSSA</span>, signal decomposition and reconstruction), multi-taper and maximum-entropy methods (<span class="caps">MTM</span> and <span class="caps">MEM</span>, spectral density estimation), bootstrap (variance and confidence interval estimation), Hodrick-Prescott filtering (trend extraction), least squares collocation (heterogeneous data integration), etc. Check out our Python library: <a href="https://github.com/fspaolo/altimpy.git">AltimPy</a>.</p>

<p><em>Multi-mission satellite altimetry to investigate long-term trends and variability in Antarctic ice-shelf&nbsp;thickness.</em></p>
<p>Antarctica&#8217;s ice shelves exert a significant dynamic constraint on the flow of ice from the grounded ice sheet to the ocean, and hence on changes in global sea level. However, our understanding of how they respond to the changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions is still rudimentary. Much of the present knowledge of our understanding of how ice shelf processes couple ice sheet changes to climate variability comes from analyses of trends in surface elevation change (dh/dt) derived from satellite altimetry data. These analyses are usually based on short records from single satellite missions and generally fail to identify neither the significant interannual-to-decadal variability that is present nor the underlying long-term trend. To avoid these limitations, we use improved procedures to integrate data from multiple satellite radar altimeter missions (Geosat, <span class="caps">ERS1</span>, <span class="caps">ERS2</span>, and Envisat) to derive reliable longterm (20+ years) quasi-continuous records of surface elevation changes for almost all of Antarctica&#8217;s ice shelf area. We show that there is considerable variability in the elevation change signal, and also that trends on short time intervals are not representative of the 20-year trend. Comparison of &#8220;modes&#8221; of variability with known climate indices and observed changes in oceanic and atmospheric conditions will allow us to determine whether the dominant cause of ice shelf change is related to climate or intrinsic ice sheet&nbsp;variability.</p>

<p><em>Satellite altimeter-derived sea surface gradient and ship gravity for an integrated marine gravity&nbsp;field.</em></p>
<p>Sea surface gradients (slopes), derived from the Geosat and <span class="caps">ERS</span>-1 satellite altimetry geodetic missions, were integrated with marine gravity data from the National Geophysical Data Center and Brazilian national surveys. Using the least squares collocation method (stochastic approach), models of free-air gravity anomaly and geoid height were constructed for the coast of Brazil with a resolution of 2&#8217; x 2&#8217;. The integration of satellite and shipborne data showed better statistical results in regions near the coast than using satellite data only, suggesting an improvement when compared to the state-of-the-art global gravity models. Furthermore, these results were obtained with considerably less input information than it was used by the aforementioned global reference models. Unlike spectral methods (deterministic approach), the least squares collocation presented a very low content of high-frequency noise in the predicted gravity anomalies. This may be considered essential to improve the high resolution representation of the gravity field in regions of ocean-continent&nbsp;transition.</p>
